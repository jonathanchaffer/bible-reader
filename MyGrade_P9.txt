My Self-evaluation:
-----------------------
Time spent:    1.5 Hours
-----------------------
Expected Grade: 100/100%
-----------------------
Justification:
Our code is organized and clear. It is well-documented
and passes all the tests. Extraneous comments have been
removed. GUI works as specified in the instructions. 
File -> Open works, and it updates the ResultView 
immediately after opening a file. And it doesn't crash.
