My Self-evaluation:
-----------------------
Time spent:    1.5 Hours
-----------------------
Expected Grade: 100/100%
-----------------------
Justification:
My code is organized and clear. It is well-documented
and passes all the tests. The TreeMapBible is
implemented correctly. Methods that iterate through
all the verses in the Bible now use a Set of Map.Entry
instead of using a VerseList of Verse.
